# Commit Shards

> Generative crystal NFT art from git commits, minted on Solana.

## What is Commit Shards?

Commit Shards is a web application that turns GitHub pull request commits into unique, deterministic generative crystal NFT art on the Solana blockchain. Each shard is derived from a commit SHA — the same hash always produces the same crystal.

## How it works

1. Enter a GitHub username to find merged pull requests
2. Select PRs to mint as crystal shard NFTs
3. Each shard is generated deterministically from the commit SHA
4. SVG art and metadata are stored permanently on Arweave via Irys
5. NFTs are minted as Metaplex tokens on Solana (devnet)
6. Optional: Sign in with GitHub for verified creator status

## Key features

- Deterministic generative art: same SHA = same crystal, always
- On-chain attributes via custom Anchor program (shard-registry)
- 1-per-SHA uniqueness enforcement
- GitHub OAuth for verified creator attribution
- Collection NFT with verified creators
- Gallery, leaderboard, and per-shard detail pages
- Social sharing (X, Bluesky, Farcaster, Lens)

## Technical stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Solana (devnet), Metaplex Token Metadata v3
- Arweave/Irys for permanent storage
- Anchor 0.29 (shard-registry program)
- next-auth v4 (GitHub OAuth)
